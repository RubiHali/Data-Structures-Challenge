# 150-Day Data Structures Challenges

A Structured **150-day** challenge to solve data structure problems, progressing from **easy** to **hard** levels. Stay
consistent, build problem-solving skills, and master data structures one day at a time.

## Problems

### Problem 1:

**Scenario:**
Given an array of n numbers, find any pair which sums to a given target.

For example,
nums = [3, 4, 5, 6]
target = 7
output = [0, 1] as 3 and 4 result into 7

**Level:**
Easy

**Category:**
Arrays

**Goal:**
Try to achieve it with optimized time and space complexity
---

### Problem 2:

**Scenario:**
Given an array of prices, find the maximum profit which could be collected.

For Example,
prices = [10, 1, 5, 6, 7, 1]
output = 6

**Level:**
Easy

**Category:**
Arrays

**Goal**
Try to achieve it with optimized time and space complexity

---

### Problem 3:

**Scenario:**
Given an array of integers, Find the majority element. A majority element is one which appears
more than n/2 times

For Example,
prices = [4, 4, 3, 2, 4]
output = 4

**Category:**
Arrays

**Level:**
Easy

**Goal:**
Try to achieve it with optimized time and space complexity

----

### Problem 4:

**Scenario:**
Given an array of integers, Move all zeroes to end of array

For Example,
nums = [4, 0, 3, 0, 4]
output = [4, 3, 4, 0, 0]

**Category:**
Arrays

**Level:**
Easy

**Goal:**
Try to achieve it with optimized time and space complexity

----

### Problem 5:

**Scenario:**
Find squares of sorted array, given array has negative integers as well

For Example,
nums = [-4, -1,  3, 6, 10]
output = [1, 9, 16, 36, 100]

**Category:**
Arrays

**Level:**
Easy

**Goal:**
Try to achieve it with optimized time and space complexity

----

### Problem 6:

**Scenario:**
Given two sorted arrays, merge them with additional space of one array

For Example,
nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]
nums2 = [2, 5, 6]
output = [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6]

**Category:**
Arrays

**Level:**
Easy

**Goal:**
Try to achieve it with optimized time and space complexity
